% % \subsection{Averaging overlapping masks}
% % In Sec. \ref{sec:aggr_affs}, we introduce a parameter-free algorithm \ref{alg:computing_affinities} to average overlapping masks and extract affinities that can be then used as edge weights of a signed graph with both positive and negative weights. 

% % In Fig. \ref{fig:alg_explained}, we show a simplified example of how Algorithm \ref{alg:computing_affinities} computes affinities between a pair of pixels $u$ and $v$.
% % In Fig. \ref{fig:mask_cases}, we list the cases in which a \maskname mask can be used or not to predict the affinity between two pixels belonging to the mask.  
% % In Fig. \ref{fig:affs_comparison} we compare affinities predicted either by averaging \maskname masks or by directly predicting them as a binary classification output of the model trained with a dense channel-wise S\o rensen-Dice loss.

% % Algorithm \ref{alg:computing_affinities} is efficiently implemented on GPU by making use of the \texttt{fold} and \texttt{unfold} functions in PyTorch \cite{NEURIPS2019_9015}.
