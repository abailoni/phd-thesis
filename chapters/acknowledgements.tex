\begin{coverpage}{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank my Ph.D. advisor Professor Fred Hamprecht, whose extensive knowledge and insight into the subject guided me through this project. He constantly challenged me to go deeper into the topic, and I much appreciated his support and encouragement both in positive and more challenging moments.

It has been a pleasure to collaborate with so many friendly, bright, and supportive people in the Image Analysis and Learning group. I especially want to thank Steffen Wolf for all the inspiring discussions about science and the many hours of fun work invested in joint research projects related to the Mutex Watershed algorithm. I also want to thank Constantin Pape for our close collaboration and the numerous brainstorming sessions on automatic segmentation of 3D EM images. Nasim Rahaman, Constantin Pape, and Steffen Wolf were a constant source of inspiration for me for developing better coding skills. I like to thank Sebastian Damrich for exciting and engaging discussions on science and beyond. I also want to thank my great officemate, Lorenzo Cerrone, for all the fun conversations that made my working days much more enjoyable. I would also like to thank present and previous lab members Steffen Wolf, Lorenzo Cerrone, Roman Remme, Sebastian Damrich, Carsten Haubold, and Elke Kirschbaum for the helpful input and for creating such an excellent and friendly working environment.

Particular thanks go to Anna Kreshuk and Ullrich K\"othe for the valuable suggestions and fruitful discussions on image segmentation, algorithms, and other exciting topics. I would also like to thank Thomas Carraro for the collaboration on the project on segmentation of EM images of batteries; and Carsten Rother for being the second referee of this work. Special thanks to Barbara Werner, always so helpful and ready to fix any unexpected bureaucratic issue.

Finally, my most special thanks go to Katya, my dearest and irreplaceable friend without whom I would not be where and who I am today. Thanks to her, the past years have been so unique and magical. Lastly, I would like to thank my sister and my wonderful parents for their unconditional love and support throughout all the steps of my life.
