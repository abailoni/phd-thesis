We have presented a fast algorithm for the clustering of graphs with both attractive and repulsive edges. The ability to consider both
\REVIEW{gives a valid alternative to other popular graph partitioning algorithms that rely on a stopping criterion or seeds.}
The proposed method has low computational complexity in imitation of its close relative, Kruskal's algorithm. We have shown which objective this algorithm optimizes exactly, and that this objective emerges as a specific case of the multicut objective. It is possible that recent interesting work \cite{lange2018partial} on partial optimal solutions may open an avenue for an alternative proof.


Finally, we have found that the proposed algorithm, when presented with informative edge costs from a good neural network, outperforms all known methods on a competitive bioimage partitioning benchmark, including methods that operate on the very same network predictions.
